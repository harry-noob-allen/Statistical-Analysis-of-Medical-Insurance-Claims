## Project Overview

In this project, our goal is to uncover and analyze the determinants that contribute to the variability in insurance costs across the United States healthcare landscape. The Jupyter Notebook (`analysis_code.ipynb`) provides a detailed exploration of our data, preprocessing steps, analysis techniques, and results.

The final report (`final_report.pdf`) offers an in-depth narrative of our investigative approach, the methodologies employed, and the key determinants we identified that influence insurance costs. 

Our presentation slides (`presentation_slides.pdf`) provide a concise overview of the project, emphasizing key insights and findings.

To gain a visual perspective on our project and better understand the determinants of variability in insurance costs, we encourage you to watch our video presentation on YouTube: [Project Video Presentation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8VYyrw_g9g).

Feel free to explore the files, delve into our analyses, and engage with the content to deepen your understanding of the factors influencing insurance costs across the United States healthcare landscape.

Thank you for your interest in our project!
